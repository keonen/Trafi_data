## Synopsis

Trafi shares some vehicle data in csv files. Here is simple php-script for searching vehicle data from mysql database.

## Code Example

Search vehicles by inputting car, model and first registration year 2012, month 2012-03 or date 2012-03-16 to form fields.

## Motivation

I was interested in how to import almost 5 million rows of data from csv file to mysql database.

## Installation

Create mysql table and import vehicle data from csv file to the database.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
